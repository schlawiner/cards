# Archipelago Cards! https://archipelago-desktop.surge.sh

Fork of Haaken Lid's Itras By Card app for digital use of the cards for the Tabletop RPG **Itras By** (Ole Peder Gi√¶ver,  Martin Bull Gudmundsen), altered to display the cards for the related story game **Archipelago** (Matthijs Holter) instead (in English for now, considering adding German card versions, too).

## Features:
- original Archipelago card fronts and backs
- draw Fate cards (once per player per session)
- draw Resolution cards (anytime someone says "This may not be quite so easy!" when you try to do a thing)

## Try them!
